<h2 style="text-align: center;">Description</h2>

<p>In this stage, you should find an inverse of a matrix. You need to use the knowledge you’ve got in the previous stages. Inverse matrix <span class="math-tex">\( A^{−1} \)</span> is the matrix, the product of which to original matrix <span class="math-tex">\(A\)</span> is equal to the identity matrix. To get the idea about inverse matrices you can watch <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMLUikdDQGk" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">this</a> video.</p>

<p><span class="math-tex">\( A \times A^{-1} = A^{-1} \times A = I \)</span></p>

<p>The identity matrix is the matrix in which all elements of the main diagonal are ones and other are zeros. Example of <span class="math-tex">\(4, 4\)</span> identity matrix:</p>

<p><span class="math-tex">\(I_{4,4} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp;0\\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp;0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1&amp;0 \\0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp;1\end{pmatrix}\)</span></p>

<p>Inverse of a matrix can be found using this formula:<br>
       <br>
<span class="math-tex">\( A^{-1} = \dfrac{1}{det(A)} \times C^T \)</span></p>

<p>As you can see it contains a lot of operations you implemented in the previous stages. It is: finding cofactors of all the elements of the matrix, transposition of the matrix, finding the determinant of a matrix, multiplication of a matrix by a constant.</p>

<p><span class="math-tex">\( det(A) \)</span> is determinant of matrix <span class="math-tex">\( A \)</span> and <span class="math-tex">\( C^T \)</span> is the matrix consist of cofactors of all elements of the matrix <span class="math-tex">\( A \)</span> transposed relatively main diagonal. Inverse matrix can’t be found if <span class="math-tex">\( det(A) \)</span> equals zero. You can look at the calculation example in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfhzwNkMNg4" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">this</a> video.</p>

<p>Also, you can implement a method that can print a matrix in a readable way - every column would be correctly aligned. And you can round the results by two or more digits.</p>
